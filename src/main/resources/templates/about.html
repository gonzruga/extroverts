                <h3>ABOUT THIS PLATFORM AND HOW IT WORKS </h3>

                <p>
                    This platform is for extroverts to connect by listing their favourite hobbies and activities.
                    They can request to be hosted. The platform also recommends people you can consider connecing with or hosting.
                    The platform works in three basic steps:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Create your private profile. (bookmark it or save user id. You shall receive via email within hours.)</li>
                    <li>Add your favorite hobbies and Stebby activites.</li>
<!--                    <li>Send a NUDGE to a fellow extrovert.</li>-->
                    <li>The platform shall recommend extroverts to you. It learns the more you accept recommendations</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    We are currently focusing on extroverts since they are more likely to be willing to:
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>share information about their passions. </li>
                    <li>meet new people. </li>
                    <li>host people </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    The main preposition and problem the platform is solving is that some people are hesistant to do something unless they know someone.
                    The platform provides a chance for you to find one person to connect with so you are not a stranger.
                    For people willing to help newbies engage in any activity, this platform is for you.
                    <br><br>
                    The platform will recommend to you fellow extroverts worth connecting with, for example:
                    <strong><i>* "We recommend you host a South American designer who likes travelling and arts".
                    * "Would you be willing to try summer sailing in the sea? An Estonian banker is willing to host people".</i></strong>
                    If you accept to connect with someone, you will recieve via email a link to a private chat page.
                    You can use the chat secret ID to access that chat anytime from the platform.

<!--                    You will recieve pieces of information from their bios, hobbies-->

<!--                    Moreover, a key feature of the platform is sending a 'NUDGE’ to another extrovert to either:-->
                </p>

<!--                <ul>-->
<!--                    <li>Request to be hosted or host. </li>-->
<!--                    <li>Request for information. </li>-->
<!--                </ul>-->

                <p>
<!--                    In the Nudge you shall include a message to the host and provide which contact information they should use to contact you.-->
<!--                    You may opt to provide your Telegram handle.-->
                    Introverts are still welcome to join – in the future we shall add more diverse features for a wider audience.
                    This is still a BETA version with work in progress. The design will be continuously improved.
                    Your feedback is highly appreciated, particularly about the core functionalities of creating profiles, hobbies, stebbies, nudges and reviews.
                </p>

                <h6>What is HOSTING?</h6>

                <ul>
                    <li>Hosting is basically guiding someone. Providing information needed for the guest to engage in the respective activity.
                        Hosting is being physically present or remotely available to provide any needed information and answer questions. </li>
                    <li>The host introduces the guest to people known by the host. </li>
                </ul>

<!--                <p>-->
<!--                    It is understandable if a host may not be physically present – this should be communicated in advance.-->
<!--                    It happens that a person gets too many hosting requests and/or has other commitments preventing him from being physically present on the day the guest is available or selected to engage in the respective activity.-->
<!--                    We believe this is still okay and that the guest can still benefit from getting insights, advice and guidance. The host may refer the guest to another person confirmed that will be physically present –-->
<!--                    if that person is also a user of this platform the guest should send him/her a NUDGE, otherwise this platform can't help any further and it is the discretion of the guest to accept the referral.-->
<!--                </p>-->

<!--                <h6>Hosting is NOT:</h6>-->
<!--                <ul>-->
<!--                    <li>-->
<!--                    A host is not a baby sitter. The host is not required to be with the guest the whole time, but a decent amount of time to enable the guest to navigate alone. The host helps 'onboarding' the guest to have a smooth landing/transition into discovering the activity.-->
<!--                    The guest is expected to be able to thereafter proceed to explore the activity and people.-->
<!--                    </li>-->
<!--                    <li>Hosting is not a date - unless willingly explicitly mutually agreed. </li>-->
<!--                    <li>The host is not expected to pay for anything unless he/she volunteers to do so. </li>-->
<!--                </ul>-->

                <p>
                    <b>User Login: </b>we have currently disabled user login to make it easy to use the platform immediately. We shall enable it in due time.
<!--                    The consequence of that is you can't edit sensitive details (phone, email etc) to do so send instructions to the admin.-->
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Messaging: </b>at the moment inter-user communication will be through private chat board/pages. Later we shall implement traditional messaging.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Images: </b>adding pictures and other multi-media will be enabled in the future.
